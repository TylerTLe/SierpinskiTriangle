# Sierpinski Triangle

This GitHub repository contains an interactive web application that generates and visualizes the Sierpinski Triangle, a captivating fractal pattern named after the Polish mathematician Wacław Sierpiński. The application is built using JavaScript and HTML, allowing users to explore the recursive nature of the Sierpinski Triangle and observe its mesmerizing self-similar structure.

## What is the Sierpinski Triangle?

The Sierpinski Triangle is a geometric shape that emerges from a simple recursive algorithm. Starting with an equilateral triangle, the algorithm repeatedly divides it into four smaller congruent triangles by connecting the midpoints of its sides. This process is then applied to each of the resulting smaller triangles, creating an infinite pattern of progressively smaller triangles within triangles.

## Getting Started

To use the Sierpinski Triangle Generator, follow these steps: <br><br>

Step 1: Visit the Sierpinski Triangle Generator website [here](http://tylerle.me/SierpinskiTriangle/) <br><br>

Step 2: Once the website loads, you will see three dots displayed on the screen in the formation of a triangle. <br><br>

Step 3: Click anywhere within the triangle formed by the three points of the Sierpinski Triangle. This action will trigger the algorithm, and the generator will automatically create a new iteration of the Sierpinski Triangle. <br><br>

Step 4: Observe the new triangle that is generated. It will consist of smaller triangles within it, forming the self-similar pattern of the Sierpinski Triangle. <br><br>
    
Step 5: If you want to reset the page and start again with the original Sierpinski Triangle, look for the button located in the top right corner of the website. Click on the button to reset the visualization and return to the initial state. <br><br>

**optional** Step 6: Repeat steps 3-5 to explore different iterations and variations of the Sierpinski Triangle by clicking within the triangle and resetting as desired.
